# RTSP to Webcam

This is a project to convert your cheap chinese RTSP "Webcam" via php to a php hosted webcam.
I do not thrust the chinese webcam, so it is blocked (via my router) to access the internet.
RTSP is badly supported by browsers, so it is transcoded via ffmpeg to something most browsers should understand.
This transcoded video stream is then published via a simple PHP website.
The website uses only one user/password so far.

Use this to connect your cheap chinese to the internet without exposing yourself to the bad security risk from the camera.
Keep a watch on your dog/plant/baby/apartment from anywhere on the planet.
